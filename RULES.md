# Objectives

* Interpretable ML results
* Scikit-learn compliant `joblib` file with trained model (one file per model)
* Provide GUIs to analyze the datasets and ML models
* Classification should be flexible in resolution

# Rules

* Push to the repo often!
* Python code (as PEP 8 compliant as possible)
* Git commits start with the 3 letter code of the project (PYF, STP, etc.)
* You can use Jupyter notebooks for exploration but the end result should be a `.py` set of files that can be run from the terminal.
* Functions definitions should have their own separate file(s)
* Have separate files for: data cleaning, training, testing, evaluation
* Have paths as clearly stated variables that can be changed easily
